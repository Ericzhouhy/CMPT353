(1) the reddit-0 data set takes 0m15.657s
(2) no schema specified and not caching data set takes 0m29.610s
(3) with a schema but not caching data set takes 0m29.610s
(4) with both a schema and caching data set takes 0m28.318s

The time took by reddit-0 is around 15.657s and the time took by reddit-2 for other 3 approach is around 30s but below 30s so we can conclude reading file and calculating average took almost same time, but reading file took slightly more time.

I use .cache() after cleaning data and before groupBy function, that's in my line 34
