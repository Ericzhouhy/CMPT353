1.	The result of the calculation is the predict value of rating data based on the timestamp of that rating.
	The type is of value is "Series" and the value is the predicted result by the hypothesis

2.	The line is produced based on the slope and intercept value we caluculated by linregress function for predicting rating by timestamp. And the reason for created_at values and timestamp values paired correctly is the data[timestamp] is another form of created_at value. All the date data could be transformed into a timestamp number and it's invertible.
