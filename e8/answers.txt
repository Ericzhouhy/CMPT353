Bayesian classifier:     0.526  0.604
kNN classifier:          0.708  0.725
Rand forest classifier:  0.713  0.739
As Rand forest classifier has the highest score, it did the best for the colour-prediction.
The rand forest classifier leverages the power of multiple trees and their collective decision-making to achieve better accuracy.
Different color spaces encode color information differently, and the choice of color space can impact the performance of certain models.

Yes, the model seems to make reasonable mistakes since some nearby city has similar weather condition, adding some other data like longitude and latitude might work better.
